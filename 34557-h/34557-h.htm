            <img src="images/I.jpg" alt="I" align="left">T may be
            said of Purgatory that if it did not exist it would
            have to be created, so eminently is it in accord with
            the dictates of reason and common sense. The natural
            instinct of travellers at their journey's end is to
            seek for rest and change of attire. Some are begrimed
            with mud, others have caught the dust of a scorching
            summer day; the heat or cold or damp of the journey has
            told upon them and their attire. Perhaps, even, the way
            has made them weary unto sickness, and they crave for
            an interval of absolute repose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Travellers from earth, covered with the mud and dust of
            its long road, could never wish to enter the
            banquet-room of eternity in their travel-stained
            garments. "Take me away!" cried Gerontius to his angel.
            It was a cry of anguish as well as desire, for
            Gerontius, blessed soul though he is, could not face
            heaven just as earth had left him. He has the true
            instinct of the traveller at his journey's end. Dust,
            rust, and the moth have marked their presence, and even
            the oddities and eccentricities of earthly pilgrimage
            must be obliterated before the home of eternity can be
            entered. <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i> is
            interpreted, nothing short of heaven for those who have
            crossed the bourne. But, if the heavenly gates are
            thrown open to the travellers all weary and footsore,
            "not having on a nuptial garment," no heterogeneous
            meeting here on earth could compete with the gathering
            of disembodied spirits from its four quarters. It is
            human ignorance alone which canonizes all the departed,
            and insists on a direct passage from time to heaven.
            The canonization is not ratified in heaven, because
            heaven would not exist if it took place. The Beatific
            Vision is incompatible with the shadow of imperfection.
            To act as if it were belongs to the same order of
            things as rending the garment of Christian unity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Purgatory makes heaven, in the sense that heaven would
            not be possible for men without it. As well might we
            try to reach a far-off planet, which is absolutely
            removed from our sphere, an unknown quantity, though a
            fact science does not dispute. Heaven without Purgatory
            is a far-off planet which must ever remain beyond our
            touch and ken, for it would be easier that we in our
            present condition should traverse space than that the
            sinner should see God face to face.
        </p>
        <p>
            The vestibule of heaven, in which souls tarry in order
            to make their preparations, and to be prepared for the
            feast of eternity, can scarcely be an abode of pure
            suffering. Heart and mind, as they exist in the
            <i>anima separata</i>&mdash;that is, understanding and
            love&mdash;are at rest. On earth mind and heart are the
            source of the greatest pain as well as the greatest
            joy. The severest pain of body may be accompanied by
            happiness and a mind at rest, whereas remorse makes
            life unbearable. Hidden criminals at large have not
            unfrequently given themselves up to justice in order to
            arrive at peace by a public execution, that being the
            penalty demanded by their tortured conscience. Death,
            however ignominious, rather than remorse&mdash;the
            backbite of inwit, in the quaint language of our
            forefathers. Remorse is not in the organs of sense, but
            a purely intellectual operation, proper to man. It
            cannot be softened by worldly prosperity or riches,
            fame or success. On the other hand, a good conscience
            is a well-spring of happiness, be the outward
            circumstances of a man's life what they may. Bodily
            pain would add to the torture of remorse, just as it
            might deaden the joy of a good conscience, <i>per
            accidens</i>, as theologians say. Conjointly with the
            mind, the heart causes the keenest sufferings and the
            deepest joys of human life, joys and sufferings which
            are acted upon in the same way indirectly by pain of
            body. A severe toothache, for instance, quickens the
            pangs of remorse, whilst it deadens joy proceeding
            either from the intellect or the heart. It would madden
            a bride on her wedding morning, without in reality
            affecting her happiness. The root of both joy and grief
            is in the soul, not in the body. Conscience is the
            "worm which never dieth"&mdash;that is, hell, the
            torment created by man himself for his own punishment.
            The same applies to Purgatory, as far as conscience has
            been sinned against. The soul has created its own
            torment, but in Purgatory the fires die out because
            they deal with the <i>anima separata</i>, never with
            the senses. In each case the nature of the fire, which
            may not be material and is exercised on spirits, must
            remain mysterious to us. At least we can understand it
            by analogy. Remorse in the tortured soul of a murderer
            is sufficient to destroy the prosperous and pampered
            life of the body. Intensify it by the measure of
            eternity, and it may alone constitute hell. That is
            probably what theologians mean when they say that the
            fire of hell and that of Purgatory are identical. What
            fire is to the body, that burning sorrow is to the
            spirit, who sees things in their true light, and weighs
            lost opportunities in the balance of the next world.
        </p>
        <p>
            By sorrow and love earth shows us the material, to
            speak in human language, out of which Purgatory is
            made. The pangs of remorse deaden the most intense
            bodily pain, and the power of love does more than
            render hard things sweet. <i>Many waters cannot quench
            charity, neither can the floods drown it</i>, says the
            voice of love in the Canticles. Whether human or
            divine, it is as a burning fire, which consumes all
            minor cares. I will not deal with passion, but with
            love in its noblest form and expression; the love, for
            instance, of a mother, or of a wife, or of an affianced
            bride. Earth has nothing better in the natural order
            than disinterested affection, a foreshadowing of
            Purgatory as much as the torture of remorse. Sin will
            not be there, neither will money-making; love will be
            the coin of the realm. <i>Non subtrahuntur
            delici&aelig; sed mutantur</i>. As the action of
            purification is perfected, each human intelligence in
            Purgatory will be more and more fixed on God. The soul
            disengaged from the senses will learn all the more
            promptly the lesson of Purgatory, if it has not been
            learnt here, the perfect love of God. There is joy in
            suffering under these conditions, a joy which makes
            pain acceptable. A <i>promessa sposa</i> will be
            patient with sudden illness, and racking pain, if they
            promise to be temporary. She can afford to be so as
            long as her heart is fixed on the wedding day. The
            <i>sposo</i>, indeed, may weary of a sick affianced
            bride, and court another. This can happen in human
            things, but never in Purgatory. The souls there are
            fixed on the Unchangeable One, who can never prove them
            false; so be the suffering what it may, they can afford
            to bide his time, secure that the reward of their
            heart's long watching will never pass away. Their
            wedding day is far removed from the vicissitudes of
            earth, and the fever-tossed brides may suffer in
            perfect peace.
        </p>
        <p>
            On earth it is more difficult to unlearn than to learn
            afresh, and it must be feared that to the great
            majority Purgatory is an unlearning. The idols, the
            false standards of the world must be swept away. In the
            first instant of eternity the soul has an intuitive
            perception of her errors. It may be likened to arrival
            in a foreign land, of which the language has been badly
            learnt at home. English-French will serve as a
            comparison. It is very soon proved to be no French at
            all. The foreigner immediately says: "I am all wrong. I
            must begin again." He had much better have learnt no
            French&mdash;at least his professor will think
            so&mdash;for he has to unlearn more than he learns, his
            expressions, his quantities, his pronunciation. Fully
            aware as he now is of his shortcomings, the work of
            imparting real knowledge will take time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We say that knowledge is power. In Purgatory it is
            love; and who can call the process of arriving at it
            all painful, even if accompanied by torments? It is the
            burst of eternal day, coming gradually to those who
            ascend the steep mountain-side of Purgatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            In it, as in the Father's house, there are many
            mansions. Whilst the saint may be punished with the
            pain of loss only, the sinner may be racked with fiery
            torments, "saved yet so as by fire." Whatever the
            "mansion," the suffering proceeds from the same cause,
            varying in degree: remorse for the past, love of God in
            the present. That which on earth causes our torture and
            our joy is prolonged in Purgatory, with this
            difference: <i>Here</i> our minds and hearts are
            unquiet because they are not fixed on God: <i>there</i>
            knowledge and love will be first established on their
            true centre, and then perfected.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one single and unique instance of purgatory on
            earth&mdash;not purgatory in the loose sense in which
            the expression is often used. Suffering by itself is
            not synonymous with Purgatory. There must be the
            absolute certainty of heaven, which has been given only
            once. <i>Amen, Amen, I say to thee, this day shalt thou
            be with me in paradise</i>. The word was spoken by our
            Lord himself to one in fearful torture and ignominy.
            Was the good thief conscious of pain with that divine
            promise ringing in his dying ears? It may well be
            doubted.
        </p>
        <p>
            He has spoken the same word to each of the holy souls:
            "Thou shalt be with me in paradise"; and they are so
            moulded to his will that his hour is theirs. They long
            to hear <i>this day</i>, but the security of Our Lord's
            promise tempers their suffering and puts it far above
            all pains and sorrows of earth. Who would not submit to
            be crucified, if <i>To-day thou shalt be with me in
            paradise</i> were the reward? Yet a state of
            crucifixion and perfect security is that of the souls
            whose blessedness exceeds their torments.
        </p>
        <p>
            These thoughts may possibly suggest comfort to some who
            confuse suffering with unhappiness. They are not
            synonymous. Let us rather think of the holy souls as in
            the condition of the good thief. If they are suffering
            the torments of crucifixion they have heard the word
            which is to be their joy through eternity: <i>Thou
            shalt be with me in paradise!</i>
        </p>
